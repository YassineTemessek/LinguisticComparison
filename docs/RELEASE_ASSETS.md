# Release assets (LV0)

Full processed datasets are built and published by LV0 (the shared data core):

- `https://github.com/YassineTemessek/LinguisticDataCore-LV0`

LV0 publishes **per-language zip bundles** (date versioning) under GitHub Releases.

## Use in LV3

Prefer fetching LV0 release assets and extracting them into the LV3 repo root so `data/processed/...` exists.

See `docs/LV0_DATA_CORE.md`.

## Notes

- LV3 keeps `resources/samples/processed/` tracked for quick smoke tests without any large downloads.
