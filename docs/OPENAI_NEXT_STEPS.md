Next session quick plan (keep memory light)
1) Arabic: ingest Resources/qac_morphology/quran-morphology.txt with full transliteration/IPA; ingest Arabic roots (Resources/arabic_roots_hf parquet, Resources/arabic_roots_taj KhorsiCorpus) and add POS/stems.
2) English: POS still sparse for colloquials; consider better heuristics or external tagger; finalize dedupe rules if needed.
3) Stardict: current filters still allow some abbreviations/names; tighten filters and map POS to schema; align to concept tiers.
4) Greek/Latin IPA: refine long vowels/breathings; drop remaining symbol/initialism entries.
