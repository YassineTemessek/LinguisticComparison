# Gemini outputs

This folder contains **generated artifacts** produced by scripts under `Gemini/scripts/`.

By default, the actual output files are not committed to Git (see `.gitignore`). Keep this folder for local runs, sharing, and debugging.

Typical outputs:

- `leads_full.jsonl` (full pipeline leads)
- `prototype_leads.jsonl` (prototype matcher leads)
- `leads_analysis.txt` (summary report)
