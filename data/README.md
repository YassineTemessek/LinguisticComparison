# Data folder

This project uses large raw/processed linguistic datasets under `data/`, which are intentionally **not** committed to GitHub by default (see `.gitignore`) to keep the repository lightweight.

If you need the data to run the pipelines, place your local datasets back under:

- `data/raw/`
- `data/processed/`
