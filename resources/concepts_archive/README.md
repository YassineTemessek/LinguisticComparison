# Concept archive (legacy)

These files are a **legacy concept inventory** (v2.5) used earlier as a seed list for concept IDs and tiers.

They are kept for reference/traceability and are **not** the canonical concept registry used by the current pipeline.

Current canonical concepts live under `resources/concepts/` (e.g., `concepts_v3_2_enriched.jsonl`).
