# Resources

`resources/` contains **tracked, lightweight reference assets** that are not large datasets.

Examples:

- `resources/concepts_archive/`: legacy concept lists kept for traceability.

Large corpora/datasets belong under `data/` (which is intentionally not committed to GitHub by default).
